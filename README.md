## How it works

After downloading the application, prepare the software with:
```
npm install
```

next, execute:
```
npm start
```
then open your web browser with the following address:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Alternately, the application is available in Heroku, through this address:

```
https://devschat.herokuapp.com/
```


## Model:

Unique model transmitted through the websocket is message which is as follows:

```
message: {
  id: <timestamp>,
  user: <string>,
  content: <string>,
  channel: <string>
}
```
